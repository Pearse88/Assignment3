A drawing program that allows users to draw pictures on a canvas e.g. Paint program in windows.
The user has the option to choose from several shapes including, line, square/rectangle, circle, rounded edged square, polygon, or the user can also choose to draw free hand using the mouse.  
The user also has the option to fill a shape, undo a previous action or redo a previous action the user can also erase the canvas by clicking on the eraser button. 
The part that I found most difficult which is also highlighted in the video is the function of saving the file, I used several resources both online and books to figure out how to complete this function.
I have added an image of the canvas, and all of the shape buttons in an images file which is in the repository.
