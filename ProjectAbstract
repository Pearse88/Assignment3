Objective:
The objective of my project is to create a simple drawing program that will teach kids to draw in simple steps.

The title of my project is Doodles(not final, name change under consideration). The application is a drawing program that will teach kids in a step by step process of how to draw an image that they have choosen from a library of images. 
The basic idea of the application came from my own neice and nephew. Both own their own tablets with drawing programs installed on them however they only seem to scribble and mess with it, they don't actually spend to much time drawing an actual picture. Even if my application doesnt go to market I hope they will get some use from it. 
The user will be able to search for an item or choose from a gallery with several genres.  The graphics and general look of the application will be very appealing to children. 

I plan on using Java as my language to build the application.  As of yet I havent chosen what Java IDE i will be using however it is between Eclipse and NetBeans.  As I am not that familiar with either I will decide which one to use when I feel comfortable with either one.  
I will use github to manage my project.
